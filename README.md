# Orgmathun_scripts
Here you can find some scripts we use in the RCNS Functional Organic Materials Research Group.

out2xyz.py is a script that can find the optimized geometry in a Gaussian output file and put the cartesian coordinates into a new xyz file which can be used for other calculations.
xyz2homa_homer.py is a script that can be used to calculate the HOMA and HOMER values based on the geometries
